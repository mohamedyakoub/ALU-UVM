# ALU UVM Environment

This repository contains a **UVM** environment for verifying an ALU design. It includes a complete verification structure with stimulus generation, monitoring, and coverage collection.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The **ALU** performs basic arithmetic and logic operations. This UVM environment is designed to thoroughly verify its functionality and ensure compliance with the design specifications.

### Key Features:

- **UVM Components:**
  - Environment
  - Agent
  - Sequencer
  - Driver
  - Monitor
  - Scoreboard
  - Coverage Collector
- **Test Scenarios and Sequences:**
  - Addition, subtraction, and logic operations
  - Randomized stimulus for comprehensive testing

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Simulation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have one of the following simulators installed:

- **QuestaSim**
- **VCS (Synopsys)**

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alu-uvm.git
   cd alu-uvm
   ```
2. Compile the UVM Environment (Example: QuestaSim):
   ```bash
   vlog -sv tb/*.sv src/*.sv
   ```
3. Run the Simulation:
   ```bash
   vsim -c -do "run -all" work.top
   ```

## âœ… Verification Plan

1. **Functional Testing:** Verify all ALU operations (e.g., add, subtract, AND, OR).
2. **Corner Cases:** Ensure correct handling of edge conditions (e.g., overflow, underflow).
3. **Random Stimulus:** Randomized operand generation for robust testing.

## ðŸ“Š Coverage

The UVM environment collects both **functional** and **code** coverage. The coverage report is generated after the simulation completes.
